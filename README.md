## Inspiration
Heart disease are the leading cause of death globally, taking an estimate-ed 17.9 million lives each year. Heart diseases are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. More than four out of five Heart disease deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. The inspiration for a Heart Disease Prediction machine learning model is to predict the heart disease in prerequisite based on the resting blood pressure, Serum Cholesterol level, fbs(fasting blood sugar), resting electrocardiographic, maximum heart rate achieved, etc. By leveraging advanced technology and data analysis, this project aims to help doctors in predicting the disease will occur or not for their patients.

## What It Does 
The heart disease prediction application while help the doctors make informed decision about the heart disease of their patient’s. This application uses machine learning algorithms to analyse patient data and predict the likelihood of developing heart disease. The application takes into account various factors such as Age, sex, chest pain, resting blood pressure, Serum Cholesterol level, fbs(fasting blood sugar), resting electrocardiographic , maximum heart rate achieved, exercise induced angina, oldpeak (ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest), the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy and Thalassemia. This application can help doctor avoid wasting time in conduct unnecessary tests. 

## How I built it 
•	Imported essential libraries

•	Understand the data

•	Create a Correlation and visualize it

•	Train the model using Intel oneDAL to get better results and faster computation (Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL))

•	Train Test split

•	Model Fitting

•	Save the model

## What I learned
**Intel oneDAL:**  The model is built using Intel oneDAL. Intel oneDAL (short for Intel one Data Analytics Library) is a software library that provides a set of highly optimized algorithms for data analytics and machine learning tasks. The oneDAL library includes a wide range of algorithms for tasks such as data pre-processing, clustering, classification, regression, recommendation systems, and deep learning. These algorithms are optimized for performance on Intel architectures, using techniques such as parallelization, vectorization, and memory optimization to deliver high performance and scalability. One of the key features of oneDAL is its ease of use.

**Machine Learning:**  I likely learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict heart disease and make recommendations for doctors.

**Data Analysis:**  I likely gained experience analysing large amounts of data, to train our machine learning models.

**Collaboration:**  Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as medical science, machine learning, and data analysis, and I likely learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.

Overall building this heart disease prediction system was challenging and was satisfying at the end of the day as I could gain knowledge on the domain and as well as on the tools which helped in improving my skills and knowledge.
